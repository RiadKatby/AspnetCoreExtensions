# Feature Based Asp.net MVC
This is one of the basic features that I loved, because it is fixing the most prominant structure of MVC as there are differents folders for Models, Views, and Controllers you have to navigate all the times up and down between these folder if you only need to modify simple things

in this Additions you Can Create root foler Named Features and create Supfolder for each feature HomeFeature, AccountFeature etc.
Inside these SubFolder Features you can add Folder for Models and off course folder for Views then locate all needed files with this sub-Folder "FeautreFolder"

Off course structuing you code this way support the Clean Code architecutre which make our unkle bob happy
